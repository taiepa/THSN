### Taiepa Social Network
Taiepa Social Network is a small network built by a collaborative force.
We are proud of our code this far, and we are looking for people who want
to contribute to this project as well as joining us as we start up!

### Taiepa Hidden Social Network
Taiepa Hidden Social Network is built on the same frame as TSN, only tweaked
to run under TOR Network, as a .onion website.. This opens for users to be
completely anonymous and can publish just about anything they want.

## Looking for hosting partners.
